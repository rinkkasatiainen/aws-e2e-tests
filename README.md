# aws-e2e-tests

This repository is step by step guide in creating a serverless environment using AWS CDK, while creating end2end tests and unit tests. 

If you need help / copy-paste code, check file [step-tips.md](step-tips.md)

To follow the progress, check out [TODO list](todo.md)

Check the [Testing Strategy](test-strategy.md) to understand the end goals

## BEFORE:
To start with this step, do the following:

   * `git checkout step-1`  
   * `npm install`  # to install dependenencies
   * create file `cdk/bin/env.ts` with content
```typescript
export const env = `<your username, or something>`
```

This env file is added to `.gitignore`, and wont be overwritten when changing branches between steps. It is used to 
store all AWS environment specific details. 

## Step 1: create CDK stack:

### create first stack

To start, add a file 'cdk.json' with content:
```json
{
  "app": "node cdk/bin/cdk.js"
}
```

Then create a file 'cdk/bin/cdk.ts' with following content

```
import * as CDK from '@aws-cdk/core';
import { env } from './env';

const app = new CDK.App();

class E2EStack extends CDK.Stack {

    public constructor(parent: CDK.App, id: string) {
        super(parent, id, {
            tags: { aTag: 'avalue' },
        });
    }
}

const stack = new E2EStack(app, `test-stack-${env}`);
```

### compile typescript to Javascript for deployment

The typescript CDK stack needs to be compiled to JS. For that, execute command ```npm run tsc``` that does exactly that.

### deploy

To deploy stack to AWS, run `cdk deploy --profile e2e`

The end result should be as follows:
```
cdk deploy --profile e2e                                                                                                                                                  test-stack: deploying...
test-stack: creating CloudFormation changeset...
 0/2 | 3:06:51 PM | CREATE_IN_PROGRESS   | AWS::CDK::Metadata | CDKMetadata 
 0/2 | 3:06:52 PM | CREATE_IN_PROGRESS   | AWS::CDK::Metadata | CDKMetadata Resource creation Initiated
 1/2 | 3:06:52 PM | CREATE_COMPLETE      | AWS::CDK::Metadata | CDKMetadata 
 2/2 | 3:06:54 PM | CREATE_COMPLETE      | AWS::CloudFormation::Stack | test-stack 

 ✅  test-stack
```


## TEST

This step is done when the stack is created successfully. This might require you to have certain AWS access rights.
You can verify this from AWS Console -> Service CloudFormation -> Stacks

## Steps before step-2

To start with next step, do the following:
```bash
    git reset --hard HEAD # to remove the cdk/bin/cdk.ts file.
    git checkout step-2 # to install dependencies
    npm install # to install dependenencies
    run npm run tsc:watch to start watching changes on CDK stack files.
```




## step 0: development environment

### AWS account

You start by creating and AWS account or use existing. 
Also, setup your AWS profile configs according to what is expected. 

in `~/.aws/config` file the following should apply
```bash
[profile e2e]
region = eu-central-1
output = json
source_profile = e2e
```

If you are using a role jump to access your account,
```
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::<AWS ACCOUNT FOR ROLE>:role/<ROLENAME>
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::<AWS IAM ACCOUNT>:mfa/<USERNAME>
```

and `~/.aws/credentials`
the following details you get on your AWS Console -> IAM -> Security Credentials
```bash
[e2e]
aws_access_key_id=<access key id>
aws_secret_access_key=<secret access key>
```

### Install AWS-CLI. 

To do stuff on command line, we need AWS Command Line Interface. To install that, I've used the following procedure 

install PyENV and pyenv-virtualenv from 

``` 
   https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv 
   https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv
```

Install python version 3.7.6 (or later)

``` bash 
    pyenv install -- list #get list of possible python installations
    pyenv install 3.7.6
```

set python as version and create a virtualenv
```bash 
    pyenv local 3.7.6
    pyenv virtualenv aws
```
activate newly created virtualenv
```bash
    pyenv activate aws
```

install AWS CLI

```bash
    pip install awscli
```

## Test

This step is ready, when running command 
```bash
   npx cdk --profile=e2e list
```
fails with  message "--app is required either in command-line, in cdk.json or in ~/.cdk.json"

later, you migth want to install CDK as global node module by running `npm install -g cdk` after which you can run cdk commands without _npx_: `cdk --profile=e2e list`

```bash
$ aws lambda list-functions --profile e2e
{
    "Functions": []
}
```
